This lab explores a data set of [candy comparisons](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/).

The 538 team created an experiment that collected over 250,000 data points.
The experiment presented two randomly chosen types of candy to participants and asked them to chose which they would prefer as a trick-or-treater.
The original experiment is [here](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/).

The dataset description can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking).

The data collected characteristics of each type of candy presented to participants.
The goal of this lab is to pick your favorite candy characteristics and build a logistic model that predicts this characteristic.

Instructions:
1. Fork the 538 repository
	- Rep:https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking
2. Choose a candy characteristic and build a logistic regression model. Your model must include
	- 3 covariates
	- Predict a different candy characteristic than the one we go over in class.
3. Describe the coefficients corresponding to your covariates
	- Explain what the coefficients mean in terms of **log odds** 
	- Explain what the coefficients mean in terms of **odds**
	- Identify any covariates that are significant
4. Report the Accuracy of your logistic regression model


```{r}
candy <- read.csv("./candy-data.csv")
head(candy, 10)
```

# 2. Choose a candy characteristic and build a logistic regression model. 

Three covariates: crispedricewafer, chocolate, pricepercent
Prediction: is it a candy bar?
```{r}
model <- glm(bar~crispedricewafer+chocolate+pricepercent, data=candy, family=binomial)
summary(model)
```


# 3. Describe the coefficients corresponding to your covariates

# Explain what the coefficients mean in terms of **log odds** 
- In terms of log-odds, the intercept is -5.623, crispedricewafer (crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component) percentile is 1.401, chocolate percentile is 3.175, and unit price percentile is 3.768. So, candy with crispedricewafer (crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component), chocolate and higher price suggests it is candy bar, because of the positive log-odds of three covariates.

	
# Explain what the coefficients mean in terms of **odds**
```{r}
intercept <- exp(-5.623)
intercept

crispedricewafer <- exp(1.401)
crispedricewafer

chocolate <- exp(3.175)
chocolate

pricepercent <- exp(3.768)
pricepercent
```
- The intercept is is 0.0036; crispedricewafer (crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component) percentile is 4.06, chocolate percentile is 23.93, unit price percentile is 43.29
- For a candy containing crispedricewafer (crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component), its every additional unit results in 4.06 times increase in the odds it is candy bar.
- For candy containing chocolate, its every additional unit results in 23.93 times increase in the odds it is candy bar.
- A one unit increase in the price percentile results in a 43.29 times increase in the odds it is fruity. 


# Identify any covariates that are significant
None of the covariate is significant because onne of their p-value is below 0.05


# 4. Report the Accuracy of your logistic regression model
```{r}
trainingData = candy[,c('crispedricewafer','chocolate','pricepercent')]
trainingData = cbind(1,trainingData)

coefficients = as.matrix(coef(model))
predictions = as.matrix(trainingData) %*% coefficients
probabilities = exp(predictions)/(1+predictions)
decisions = ifelse(predictions>=0,1,0)

Accuracy = mean(candy$bar==decisions)
print(Accuracy)
```
We can make correct guesses about whether the candy is candy bar approximately 83/5% of the time by fitting a logistic regression model and including the price percentile, and whether it contains chocolate, and whether it contains crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component.
